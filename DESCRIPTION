Description: The package supplies a set of functions for stochastically imputing 
    missing site-level abundance measurments so sites can be aggregated to regional
    abundance for trend estimation. This package is specifically intended for trend 
    estimation for the  NMFS Alaska Fisheries Science Center's assessment of Steller 
    sea lion trends in Alaska and the U.S. west coast. Although the methodology 
    is applicable to other applications, there are aspects of sea lion surveys hard coded 
    into the analysis.
